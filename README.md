C# code 

The "CopyFilesWithin24hrs" file is code that takes recently edited files or recently created new files, within 24 hours, and copies them to  another folder.

For example, if a company has more than one location, files from a central office can be copied into a separate folder to be sent to another office location. The script can then be run once a day and that way keeps the other office location updated on edited and new files.
